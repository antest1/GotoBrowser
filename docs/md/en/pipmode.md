GotoBrowser supports PIP mode and multiwindow functions. (Android 8.0 or higher, Samsung Galaxy: 7.0 or higher)

You can use this function to play KanColle while doing other tasks on your device.

##### PIP mode
- In PIP mode, you can only watch the current game screen, and you must exit PIP mode to actually play.
- If you press X on the PIP screen, it will not exit but will go to the background.
- If you turn on "Picture-in-picture mode" in the settings, pressing the home button will switch to PIP mode instead of going to the background.

##### Multi-window mode
- Normal game play is possible in multi-window (split/pop-up) mode.
- Calling and hiding panel can be done in the <span class="link" data-move="browserui">same way as normal</span>. (touch black margin or swipe)
